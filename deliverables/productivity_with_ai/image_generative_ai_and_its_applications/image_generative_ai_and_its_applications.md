# Image Generative AI and Its Applications

## Description
This project gives an overview into the mechanisms of image generation.  It addresses the questions of how machines understand images, how images are produced from text, and how/why/where to apply image generative AI in professional spaces.  Part two of the project deals with successful use of IGAI models and creating effective prompts.  The final part of this project looks into the ethics of using IGAI.

## Ideal Audience
This project was conceptualized with our Serve IT clients in mind, but turned into a broader scope.  The intended audience now is for any 'professional'; the guides and exploration of topics are created with a general, 'non-offensive' application in mind.  

## Prerequisites
While there are not any technical or knowledge pre-requisites for the audience of this project, it may be helpful to have some pre-existing knowledge of or experience with generative AI on a basic level.
