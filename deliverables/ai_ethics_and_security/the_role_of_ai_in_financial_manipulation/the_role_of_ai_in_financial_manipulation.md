# The Role of AI in Financial Manipulation

## Description
This project examines the use of generative AI in financial manipulation, with a focus on how AI-generated deep fakes and synthetic data can be used to deceive stakeholders and manipulate financial markets. By analyzing significant cases such as the WPP deep fake scandal and the 2010 Flash Crash, the project highlights the substantial risks that AI poses to the financial sector. In addition to identifying these risks, the project explores detection and prevention strategies, advocating for the development of robust regulatory frameworks, advanced market surveillance techniques, and enhanced transparency measures. The ultimate goal is to mitigate the misuse of AI in financial systems and safeguard their integrity.
