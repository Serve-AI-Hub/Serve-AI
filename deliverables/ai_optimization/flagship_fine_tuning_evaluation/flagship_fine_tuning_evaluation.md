# Flagship Fine Tuning Evaluation

## Description
This project explores the effects of fine-tuning flagship AI models, including GPT-4O, GPT-4O Mini, and others, with a focus on enhancing user experience. The project aims to understand how fine-tuning can improve the performance and applicability of these models, particularly in contexts where user interaction is critical. While initial challenges have been encountered due to the high costs associated with fine-tuning larger models, the introduction of the more accessible GPT-4O Mini model has simplified API integration and opened new possibilities for experimentation. A key aspect of this research is to develop and validate effective methods for measuring the improvements brought about by fine-tuning. Although the project is currently in the research phase, the goal is to eventually implement these findings within Serve-AI and/or Serve-IT to fully test the models' capabilities in real-world settings.
